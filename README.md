##OpenVPN paranoid installer

###Description

OpenVPN installer for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It isn't bulletproof but has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

This project is a fork <a href="https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install" target="_blank">openvpn-install</a> with an emphasis on security.

###Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cryptopunks/openvpn_paranoid_installer/master/openvpn_paranoid_installer.sh --no-check-certificate -O openvpn_paranoid_installer.sh; bash openvpn_paranoid_installer.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.
